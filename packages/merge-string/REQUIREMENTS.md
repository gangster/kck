**Question**

Write a function `mergeStrings(a, b)` that takes strings, `a` and `b`, of varying lengths and merges them into a single string, appending any remaining characters to the end and returns it. For example you have two strings `abc` and `stuvwx`. Alternating between the two you should return `asbtcuvwx`.
